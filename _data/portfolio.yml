        desc: 'Competition project of the <b>Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals</b> course at University of Bologna.
        TablutAI is a complete knowledge game. It uses an iterative deepening alpha beta search (Russell-Norvig).
        <br><br>
        Thanks to this project I practiced the basic fundamentals of the artificial intelligence in a joyful way. 
        The competition consisted in several teams playing against each other, driving the development of the AI in 
        terms of smart heuristics, performances and software engineering quality.'

        for any kind of desktop applications.
        <br><br>
        Thanks to this project I enforced my Android (Kotlin) skill, with a particular focus to efficient and dynamic 
        custom views. I also took care of the UI/UX design of the entire platform and brand.
        <br><br>
        Dokey was involved into the application program of AlmaCube, a startup incubator in Bologna. 
        During this experience I learned about startup environment and lean approach.'

        desc: 'SAM (Software Architecture Metrics) is a naive tool that analyzes Scala source code retrieving 
        module-level metrics helpful to the software architect. The project was born as an educational project for the 
        Languages and Computational Models course at University of Bologna and it is my first approach to either <b>Scala 
        and Clean Architecture.</b>
        <br><br>  
        Developing SAM helped me to deepen multi-paradigm languages with a focus on functional programming. 
        Also, I was able to concretely apply the concepts of the Clean Architecture from the homonymous book by Robert 
        Martin.

        date: Apr 2018 - Jun 2018
        desc: 'Bachelor degree thesis. Development of an <b>Android module</b> which allow to dynamically download libraries in
        Kotlin/Android with digital signature checking at runtime.
        <br><br>
        The project will be used in an academic app for public transport mobility. The idea is to prevent personal user
        data spreading to third-party cloud systems, providing an alternative solution which aims to download executable
        code to elaborate personal data on the user device only.'
