        Thanks to this project I enforced my <b>Android (Kotlin)</b> skill, with a particular focus on efficient and 
        dynamic custom views. I also took care of the <b>UI/UX design</b> of the entire platform and brand.
        <br><br>
        Dokey was involved in the application program of AlmaCube, a startup incubator in Bologna. 
        During this experience, I learned about the startup environment and <b>lean approach</b>.'

        Thanks to this project I practiced the basic fundamentals of artificial intelligence in a joyful way. 
        The competition consisted in several teams playing against each other, driving the development of the AI in 
        terms of smart heuristics, performances and software engineering quality.'

        desc: 'SAM (Software Architecture Metrics) is a naive tool that analyzes Scala source code retrieving 
        module-level metrics helpful to the software architect. The project was born as an educational project for the 
        Languages and Computational Models course at University of Bologna and it is my first approach to either 
        <b>Scala and Clean Architecture</b>.
        <br><br>  
        Developing SAM helped me to deepen multi-paradigm languages with a focus on functional programming. 
        Also, I was able to concretely apply the concepts of the Clean Architecture from the homonymous book by Robert 
        Martin.'

        Kotlin/Android with digital signature checking at runtime.
        <br><br>
        The project will be used in an academic app for public transport mobility. The idea is to prevent personal user
        data spreading to third-party cloud systems, providing an alternative solution which aims to download executable
        code to elaborate personal data on the user device only."
