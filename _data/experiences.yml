  content: I did a summer internship in a local software company in collaboration with my high school. I worked on a dedicated project collaborating with a graphic designer intern. I took care of designing and implementing a web application learning from the codebase of a similar application of the company. My main tasks was designing the database model, developing the backend business logic and implementing the web frontend under my graphic designer collegue directives. I also wrote the user manual and the technical manual as well.
