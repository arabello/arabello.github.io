  content: 'Competition project of the Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals course at University of Bologna.
TablutAI is a complete knowledge game. It uses an iterative deepening alpha beta search (Russell-Norvig).

Thanks to this project I practiced the basic fundamentals of the artificial intelligence in a joyful way. The competition consisted in several teams playing against each other, driving the development of the AI in terms of smart heuristics, performances and software engineering quality.'

  content: 'Dokey is a productivity app for professionals that turns your mobile device into a powerful controller for any kind of desktop applications.

Thanks to this project I enforced my Android (Kotlin) skill, with a particular focus to efficient and dynamic custom views. I also took care of the UI/UX design of the entire platform and brand.

Dokey was involved into the application program of AlmaCube, a startup incubator in Bologna. During this experience I learned about startup environment and lean approach.'

  content: 'SAM (Software Architecture Metrics) is a naive tool that analyzes Scala source code retrieving module-level metrics helpful to the software architect. The project was born as an educational project for the Languages and Computational Models course at University of Bologna and it is my first approach to either Scala and Clean Architecture.

Developing SAM helped me to learn multi-paradigm software with a special focus on functional programming. Also, I was able to concretely apply the concepts of the Clean Architecture from the homonymous book by Robert Martin.'

  content: 'Bachelor degree thesis. Development of an Android module which allow to dynamically download libraries in Kotlin/Android with digital signature checking at runtime. 

The project will be used in an academic app for public transport mobility. The idea is to prevent personal user data spreading to third-party cloud systems, providing an alternative solution which aims to download executable code, elaborating personal data on the user device only.'
